# About

NOTICE: This repository is still under construction - more examples and documentation are forthcoming.

This repository is an add-on extension to the DOLFINx library providing GPU accelerated assembly routines. Currently only NVIDIA GPUs are supported, and only single-GPU assembly is supported.

# Basic Usage

```
import cudolfinx as cufem

# given UFL forms A and L representing a stiffness matrix and right-hand-side
cuda_A = cufem.form(A)
cuda_L = cufem.form(L)
asm = cufem.CUDAAssembler()
# returns a custom type CUDAMatrix
mat = asm.assemble_matrix(cuda_A)
# get PETSc matrix
petsc_mat = mat.mat()
# returns a custom type CUDAVector
vec = asm.assemble_vector(cuda_L)
#get PETSc vector
petsc_vec = vec.vector()
```

# Dependencies

This repository currently relies on my custom forks of dolfinx and ffcx, which add minor tweaks to enable the assembly code generated by FFCX to be run on the GPU. Consequently, both ffcx and dolfinx need to be installed from source. PETSc also needs to be built with CUDA support enabled.

## Custom branches

 The following branches need to be cloned of my forks:

```
git clone --branch version-0.8.0 git@github.com:bpachev/ffcx
git clone --branch feature/form_ffi_module git@github.com:bpachev/dolfinx
```

Versions of basix and ufl also need to be cloned that are compatible with dolfinx 0.8.0.

# Installation

The installation process is set up to mirror the dolfinx library, with a C++ component installed via CMake, and a Python package installed with pip. For help with installing or using the library, feel free to contact me at benjaminpachev@gmail.com.
